- **Visualization:** matplotlib, seaborn
    
- **Machine Learning Models:**
    
    - Basic Linear Regression
        
    - RANSAC Regression
        
    - Lasso Regression
        
    - Ridge Regression
        
    - ElasticNet Regression
        

## Project Workflow

1. **Data Analysis:**
    
    - Explored and cleaned the dataset using pandas.
        
    - Visualized key features and trends using matplotlib and seaborn.
        
2. **Model Training:**
    
    - Trained multiple linear regression models: Basic, RANSAC, Lasso, Ridge, and ElasticNet.
        
    - Tuned hyperparameters where applicable for optimal performance.
        
3. **Evaluation:**
    
    - Compared model performance based on $r^2 score$ metric
        
    - Plotted model predictions against true values.
        
    - Visualized model weights to understand feature importance.
